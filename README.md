# Purview-Proof-of-Concept
This is a proof of concept for purview using CUI labels. There are three main folders: artifacts, evidence, and scripts.
Designing labels for each customer's unique needs and business use case is essential. This project is an example of how perview can creat a CUI label implimented across work loads, workstations, and networks. 
Data needs to be protected on all of its states, therefore there must be rules based on policies for how data is handled and protected. 

This is still a work in progress model and intellectual concept for how perview can protect CUI. Enjoy!
